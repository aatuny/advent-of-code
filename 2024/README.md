# Advent of Code 2024

This year I'm attempting to solve puzzles using Deno/TypeScript.

Few points regarding the solutions posted to this repository:
- Each day is located in its own subfolder and has its own deno.json
- Each day reads input from within the root-folder of the day from file called 'input'. All inputs are omitted from repo per AoC FAQ.
- Come common modules used by multiple solutions (e.g., reading file) are located within common-folder
- The code readability is awful(ish) on purpose to avoid including any part of the puzzle text to code/comments. 
- Tests are not implemented (again, to avoid including any inputs)
