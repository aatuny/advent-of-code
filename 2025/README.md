# Advent of Code 2025

This year I'm attempting to solve puzzles using Rust.

Few points regarding the solutions posted to this repository:

- Each day is written as lib which is usable through cli executable (bin).
- Each day reads input from within personal-input -folder with naming convention of `yyyy-mm-dd.txt`. All inputs are omitted from repo per AoC FAQ.
- The code readability is awful(ish) on purpose to avoid including any part of the puzzle text to code/comments.
- Tests are not implemented (again with purpose of avoiding to include any inputs).
